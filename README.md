# WP Launch Check
This is a Pantheon extension for WP-CLI that runs a number of checks on a site and reports on potential optimizations or errors.

This plugin must be built into the WP-CLI source manually by rsync'ing the php/ directory to the WP-CLI php/. You can do this easily but running bash bin/build.sh
